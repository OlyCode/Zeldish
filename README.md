Zeldish
=======

Zeldish is a game written for the Ludm Dare 72 hour game.

It is written in Python and uses Pygame (a port of SDL to Python). There are builds available for Windows and Linux.

The game takes place on the Overworld map from The Legend of Zelda. You are trying to collect the seven orbs. The only enemies are skeletons and a red witch. 

You don't get any items, but you can switch tiles around using magic. The red witch can also change tiles. Really, anything that happens that seems like a bug or a glitch is, in fact, the red witch's evil magic.

I wanted to make a game where players experience a familiar space in a new way.

Thank you for playing,

Data
----

This game uses the map layout data from Al Sweigart’s Zelda Walking Tour map, which you can find out about at <http://inventwithpython.com/blog/2012/12/10/8-bit-nes-legend-of-zelda-map-data/>. 

**Though the map data was used, none of Sweigart's source code was used.**
